# NoCowards256.vim

A dark, high-contrast Vim color scheme optimized for use with sunglasses.

Requires a terminal emulator in 256 color mode.

While still a work in progress, this is my every-day color scheme that I periodically tweak and maintain.

## Installation

Add 'bestie/nocowards256.vim' to your package manager, something like

```vim
Plugin 'bestie/nocowards256.vim'
```

OR manually download the `colors/nocowards256.vim` Vimscript file and put it in your Vim colors directory.

The following configurations are required in your `vimrc`

```vim
syntax enable
colorscheme nocowards256
```

PRs / Issues gratefully received, remember to be nice.

There are plenty of rouge colors to eliminate and rough edges to tidy up.
